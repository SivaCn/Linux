    1-Install transmission-cli wich provides transmission-daemon
     
    # pacman -S transmission-cli
     
    2-Start the transmission daemon, as your regular user type:
     
    $ transmission-daemon
     
    3 - On a web browser type http://127.0.0.1:9091 to see the web client.
     
    4 - Stop the transmission-daemon, it's needed so changes to settings file can be saved.
     
    5 - Edit the configuration file
     
    $ vi /var/lib/transmission/.config/transmission-daemon/settings.json
     
    Important changes can be:
     
    "blocklist-enabled": false,
    "blocklist-url": "http://www.example.com/blocklist",
    "download-dir": "/var/lib/transmission/Downloads",
    "pidfile": "/run/transmission/transmission.pid",
    "rpc-authentication-required": false,
    "rpc-bind-address": "0.0.0.0",
    "rpc-enabled": true,
    "rpc-password": "{634e22dd6343fb51a74b74183cfca5e9a1458f24yP/vrXE.",
    "rpc-port": 9091,
    "rpc-url": "/transmission/",
    "rpc-username": "youruser",
    "rpc-whitelist": "*.*.*.*",
    "rpc-whitelist-enabled": false,
     
    Make sure user transmission has rw permissions on the Download-dir and also change permissions of the directory of pidfile
     
    # chmod -R 777 '/run/transmission'.
     
    6 - You can now start the transmission-daemon again to see the changes
     
    Normally the installation will create a user and group named transmssion, and the transmission-daemon will run as the user transmission, whose home directory is /var/lib/transmission/.
     
    And the configuration file is /var/lib/transmission/.config/transmission-daemon/settings.json.
     
    I) If you want to run transmission-daemon as your normal user (or any other user), stop the transmission-daemon.
     
    II) Start the transmission daemon, as your regular user type:
     
    $ transmission-daemon
     
    This will create the directory .config/transmission-daemon
     
    III) Set up your settings there:
     
    $ vi $HOME/.config/transmission-daemon/settings.json
     
    If you want to run transmission-daemon as a service in systemd
     
    Copy the service file and the tmpfile to systemd
     
    # cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/transmission.service /etc/systemd/system/
    # cp /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/transmission.conf /etc/tmpfiles.d/  
     
    Make sure the group transmission is created:
     
    # groupadd transmission  
     
    Add user to that group:
     
    # gpasswd -a [user] transmission  
     
    Change service file
     
    # vi /etc/systemd/system/transmission.service
     
    Change User= to your user
     
    Edit the tmpfile to the following:
     
    # vi /etc/tmpfiles.d/transmission.conf  
     
    /etc/tmpfiles.d/transmission.conf
    d /run/transmission - [user] transmission -
     
    Make configurations:
     
    # systemd-tmpfiles --create transmission.conf
     
    Reload service files:
     
    # systemctl daemon-reload  
     
    You can now use transmission-daemon as a service in systemd
     
    # systemctl start transmission.service
     
    If you would use Transmission daemon with its own group, you have to give the writing permission to transmission group in your download's directory:
     
    # chgrp transmission /path/to/download # chmod g+w /path/to/download
